{"name":"Testmonkey","tagline":"Google test web-based test runner","body":"### TestMonkey v1.0 web-based test runner for google test\r\n\r\nThis software allows C++ test harness applications compiled with the [google test library]\r\n(http://code.google.com/p/googletest) to be run easily and for unit test results to be clearly displayed in a web browser.\r\n\r\nTo build Test Monkey you will need to [download maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi),\r\nand also get the latest [jdk](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) for your platform.\r\nI'd also recommend [getting eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-422/junosr2) - an eclipse\r\nproject is included in the repository. To get going you will need to:\r\n\r\n- ensure the maven and java bin directories are on your path\r\n- run \"mvn package\" to download all the dependencies to your local maven repo and build\tthe single large testmonkey jar file in the target subdir. \r\n- from the terminal / command prompt, start the embedded web server with \"java -jar testmonkey-1.0.jar [name of google test application]\". Note you might need to prepend the name of the test app with \"./\" if running from the same directory\r\n- point your web browser at http://localhost:8080\r\n- use the interface to run individual tests / test suites.\r\n- press ctrl-c from the command prompt to stop the web server.\r\n\t\r\nNote the google test harness executable under test can be updated while the web server is running.\r\n\r\nThe following browsers have been tested:\r\n\r\n- Firefox 19.0.2\r\n- Safari 6.0.3\r\n- Internet Explorer 10 (works with minor display issues)\r\n- Google Chrome (recent versions)\r\n\t\r\nInternet Explorer versions prior to 10 are not supported due to Microsoft's historic lack of web standards compliance.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nPhil McCarthy, April 2013\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
