{"name":"Test Monkey","tagline":"Google Test web based test runner","body":"# Test Monkey v1.2\r\n## Web based test runner for the Google Test framework\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nThis software allows C++ test harness applications compiled with the [google test library]\r\n(http://code.google.com/p/googletest) to be run easily, and for unit test results to be clearly displayed in a web browser.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nThere are two ways to run the application:\r\n\r\n1. Specify which test harness applications will be run from the command line;\r\n2. Specify a test schedule file, containing details of the test harness applications to run.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, when Test Monkey starts, point your web browser at *http://localhost:8080* (or a\r\ndifferent port if specified) to use the application. Pressing *ctrl-c* will then stop the embedded web server\r\nand shut the application down.\r\n\r\nNote the google test harness executables under test can be updated while the web server is running.\r\n\r\n#### Specifying test executables\r\nTo run the application use:\r\n\t\r\n\tjava -jar testmonkey-1.2.jar path/unit_test_harness1.exe path/unit_test_harness2.exe [Port=Portnum]\r\n\t\r\nwhere *Port* is an optional parameter, and specifies the port the embedded web server will listen on.\r\n\r\n#### Using a Test Schedule file\r\nTo run the application use:\r\n\r\n\tjava -jar testmonkey-1.2.jar schedule=tests.xml [Variable=Value] [Port=Portnum]\r\n\r\nwhere tests.xml is the path to a test schedule xml file that validates against [this schema]\r\n(https://github.com/philmccarthy24/testmonkey/blob/master/UnitTestScheduleSchema.xsd), and as above\r\n*Port* specifies the web server port.\r\n\r\nThe test schedule xml file may contain a number of user defined variables of the form *$(Variable)*.\r\nThese variables are replaced at run time with the corresponding value if the variable is passed in as an optional\r\nparameter to Test Monkey. This is useful for instance to target */debug* or */release* build directories.\r\n\r\nThe schedule file takes the form:\r\n\r\n\t<UnitTestSchedule runallfrom=\"...\">\r\n\t\t<UnitTestModule runfrom=\"...\" name=\"...\" description=\"...\" testfilter=\"...\" enabled=\"true\">unit_test_harness.exe</UnitTestModule>\r\n\t\t<UnitTestModule> ... </UnitTestModule>\r\n\t</UnitTestSchedule>\r\n\t\r\n- The *runallfrom* attribute specifies where to look for **all** *unit_test_harness* files. If specified, the *runfrom* attributes are ignored.\r\n- If the *runallfrom* attribute is not present, the *runfrom* attributes specify the location of each *unit_test_harness* on a per-file basis.\r\n\tNote specifying paths with these attributes is optional and *unit_test_harness* can contain a path.\r\n- The optional *name* attribute is the friendly name used on the test modules list page.\r\n- The optional *description* attribute is the test module description used on the test modules list page.\r\n- The mandatory *testfilter* attribute is not used by Test Monkey (as this schema is shared - set it to \"*\").\r\n- The mandatory *enabled* attribute (true or false) determines whether the test module is included by Test Monkey or not.\r\n\r\nNote the test schedule file may be updated while Test Monkey is running - any changes will be detected and the file reprocessed.\r\n\r\n### The web interface\r\nThis should be self explanatory! Click on a test module from the list to open the list of tests available (note if only one module\r\nis under test, the module list is not shown, and only tests available from that single module are displayed). Select and deselect tests\r\nyou wish to run. You may select and deselect all tests, all tests in a suite, or only individual tests.\r\nSelected tests can then be executed, again either all selected tests, tests in a suite, or only individual tests.\r\n\r\n### Building the software\r\nTest Monkey is a Java application. To build it you will need to [download maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi),\r\nand also get the latest [jdk](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) for your platform.\r\nI'd also recommend [getting the eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-422/junosr2) - an eclipse\r\nproject is included in the repository. To get going you will need to:\r\n\r\n- ensure the maven and java bin directories are on your path\r\n- run \"mvn package\" from the *testmonkey* source directory to download all the dependencies to your local maven repository and build\r\n\tthe single large testmonkey jar file in the *target* sub-directory. \r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe following browsers have been tested:\r\n\r\n- Google Chrome\r\n- Firefox 19.0.2\r\n- Safari 6.0.3 (known issue with CSS background images sometimes disappearing)\r\n- Internet Explorer 10 (works with minor display issues)\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer versions prior to 10 are not supported due to Microsoft's historic lack of web standards compliance.\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\nRelease v1.2 (minor bugfix update):\r\n\r\n- Improvement in rest server test name parsing, recognition of comments after test case name\r\n- Updates to front end (XSLT and javascript) to prevent gtest test suites or cases marked as DISABLED_ from being enabled or selectable.\r\n\r\nPhil McCarthy, April 2014\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
